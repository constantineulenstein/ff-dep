Fish and chips uses halibut and a batter that does not leave you feeling you ate something greasy and heavy. Lobster roll is very nice as it\u2019s focused on the lobster with a light aoli dressing and seasoning. Try the quarter mile cocktail with house made grenadine",

The rotisserie chicken was grilled very well and not dry at all. Dessert is always the best part and the sundae not only had macadamia nuts inside the brownie but also powdered macadamia nuts in the ice cream. This is a great place to go for a celebration dinner.",
