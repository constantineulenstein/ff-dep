The pizza got a little soggy on the bottom and a little cold by the time I got home though, so I would recommend sitting in and eating the pizza fresh. It's a relatively thin crust with kind of chewy edges, I enjoyed it but would also say that I've had other pizzas that are more to my taste.\n\nThey have a couple vegetarian options, you can check their website.\nThe interior decor is quite nice and it seems to have a nice ambiance for dine in, though I only did take out (phone order).",
