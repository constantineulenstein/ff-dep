The man serving us was very ready to throw our sandwich away until I was able to calm him down and apologize. This is very unprofessional, all he needed to do was ask us to not eat or pull our masks down. I was startled and confused. This is not something that should happen in a professional work place and it is also something completely avoidable. There was another man eating a sandwich right behind us so clearly eating inside is okay and allowed. This shouldn't happen.",
