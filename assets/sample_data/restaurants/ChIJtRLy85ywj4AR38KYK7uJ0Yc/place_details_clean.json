Resumed dine in at this place, the dishes (that I normally order) still remain high quality with a decent price, compare with other local Chinese restaurants, who raised price sky high. The service still remains high quality\u2026 plate changing after crab dish. And the don\u2019t automatically add tips, which others are forcing 18-20% of tips regardless # of dinners. Of course we gave 20% tips for the lunch because of satisfaction. Highly recommend live crab with salty eggs/\u54b8\u86cb\u9ec4\u73cd\u5b9d\ud83e\udd80\ufe0f.
